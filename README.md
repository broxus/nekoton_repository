```yaml
dependencies:
  nekoton_repository:
```

## Basic usage 🛠

Setup DI:

```dart
@InjectableInit(  
  externalPackageModulesBefore: [
    ExternalModule(NekotonRepositoryPackageModule),
  ],
)  
void configureDependencies() => getIt.init();  
```

Init:

```dart
Future<void> configureNekoton() async {
  final nekotonRepository = inject<NekotonRepository>();

  await nekotonRepository.setupNekotonAndStorage(
    storage: inject<NekotonStorageService>(),
  );
}
```

## Melos magic 🪄

Using [melos](https://melos.invertase.dev/) makes it very easy to work with the project, so enjoy.

You can run any job interactively run running `melos run` and selecting needed case or directly (e.g. `melos run test`).

### Bootstrap 🏁

Melos takes care about dependencies of all packages, including managing of local-generated library version. So, just run:

```
melos bs
```

### Codegen 🦾

This thing will run all code generators for all packages:

```
$ melos run codegen
```

### Clean up 🧹

Just run commands below to clean all, including build directories and flutter projects.

```
melos clean
```

### Tests ✔️

You can run all tests at one by running this command.

```
melos run test
```

### Code 📊

You can run code analysis:

```
melos run analyze
```

### Code format 🗃️

```

## Conventional Commits ❤️

[This magic](https://melos.invertase.dev/guides/automated-releases#versioning) will update version and build our library automatically using commit messages and tags. [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0) is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages.

## Version 🏷️

Package version control is done by melos. It runs by gh action 'Create version PR' ```melos version -a --yes```.

## Continuous Integration 🤖

Nekoton Repository comes with a built-in [GitHub Actions workflow][github_actions_link] powered by [Very Good Workflows][very_good_workflows_link] but you can also add your preferred CI/CD solution.

Out of the box, on each pull request and push, the CI `formats`, `lints`, and `tests` the code. This ensures the code remains consistent and behaves correctly as you add functionality or make changes. The project uses [Very Good Analysis][very_good_analysis_link] for a strict set of analysis options used by our team. Code coverage is enforced using the [Very Good Workflows][very_good_coverage_link].

## Github Secrets 🔑

`BOT_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Personal access token (PAT) used to fetch the repository. We should use PAT and not default GITHUB_TOKEN because ["When you use the repository's GITHUB_TOKEN to perform tasks, events triggered by the GITHUB_TOKEN, with the exception of workflow_dispatch and repository_dispatch, will not create a new workflow run"](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/triggering-a-workflow#triggering-a-workflow-from-a-workflow). We want to trigger a workflow from the workflow (to run tests), so we need to use PAT. This thing is used in `version` workflow.
